I was told that it's being made and it should be two more weeks. Three weeks later I called again and they told me they'll call me when the door is ready to be installed and when it does arrive they will inspect it for a couple days. Finally one more month passed I was called to schedule door install. \n\nInstallation seemed to go well the first day until I noticed our marble was cracked. Of course according to master craftsman workers it was already like this. Even when we called the receptionist was trying to say we cracked it. Somehow she can tell a new crack from old crack from her cubicle. What I find odd about all this is, after inspecting our door for two days they still sent a messed up door with noticeable cracks on door frame, this is after they checked for who knows how long. They tried to hide it with paint, not smart because paint shouldn't be used as a filler. And our stucco patch around the outside door was supposed to be matched as close as possible, but that wasn't even close. If that was the best they can do, they are in trouble. Grey, rough and cracked all over. Obviously they just slapped one coat of cement and called it a match. \n\nThey sent someone that knew what he was doing the same day because they wanted to get paid. He said that he can tell the marble was freshly cracked, the stucco patch was bad, and the cracks on door will be filled. They came when I was available and fixed everything. But before that, what a headache. Even though I still have to paint stucco.  Door looks good, but the wait was not.  We probably won't be using Master Craftsman for our windows.", "stars": 2.0}

Anyway, I wished he trimmed down the nails some more (I should have said something).  As he was clipping my big toes with this nipper, it hurt so bad I started saying, \"ouch!\" but he ignored my whining and went on to clipping.  Later, he went on to scrub the bottoms of my feet, and that, itself was not good because he did it so lightly that it was the uncomfortable ticklish feeling.  The nail painting itself was good though, and I was out of there in about 40 minutes, including drying time.\n\nI should add, when I walked in, there was another woman who already had her pedi started.  I was already done, and she was only halfway done.  So depending on who you get, you'll either get really fast service, or really slow service.  She commented on it to the man who was doing her nails, but disregarded what she had to say.

I try not to bash local businesses but this is to make people aware of what transpired this afternoon/evening. I want to preface this by saying that I think Jet's Pizza is some of the best pizza available in the area. After a long rainy Monday, we decided we would do something simple for dinner, so I placed an online order for Jet's Pizza at 4:37pm knowing that it normally takes 45-60 minutes to get it with traffic. I paid for this using a credit card and got a message from Jet's saying that our order would be delivered by 5:30pm. It also states that the credit card you used to pay would be required for verification of the delivery. Since the last time we ordered from Jet's I was asked for the card I didn't think much of it. At 5:45pm, no delivery. I called the store and was told it was delivered, when I questioned the fact that it was not delivered, I asked the assistant manager to ask the driver what was parked in the driveway. She called him, and I was told it was dark and he couldn't see any cars. I knew right then that he was wrong. We have plenty of motion lights, and a lighted porch so it would of been easy for him to tell what was in the driveway. The assistant manager then told me that he had a signed credit card receipt. I told her it was a forgery and that I never signed the receipt. I asked her if the driver got verification of the credit card when he delivered the pizza (Jet's Pizza policy on the website), she told me that they don't do that. To make a long story short, after a long conversation she offered to remake the order and send it. I turned this down, I asked who was the franchise owner, and she told me that it was a corporate store, but when I emailed the corporate office the reply said all locations are franchised. I then asked for her to have the manager call me. She explained he was off, I messaged Eric Martin and he replied. He was very courteous, but did tell me that this isn't the first time this has happened. If you are going to order from Jet's, either pay cash when they deliver, or go pick up.  The unfortunate part of this is that we were going to give the driver a $10 tip for a $30 order since it was so crappy out. Although this is what I think is great pizza, I definitely will never use the delivery service again. Be careful!!", "stars": 2.0}

The area where the Barista's and other employee's are stationed seems way too small and cramped and seems like they can't fit enough people back there to actually function properly.  The last weekend day that I went inside to get my coffee, I waited in line for about 10 minutes to order my pour-over decaf coffee, and then waited an additional 15 minutes to actually get my drink . As I got closer to the register area and could see behind the counter, I saw that it was a total mess.  The floor was filthy (it was noon), with wrappers and crumbs all over it.  (The woman in front of me noticed it at the same time and made a comment to me when she saw me looking too). The area where you pick up your coffee had 4 old drinks sitting there that were time-stamped 2 hours earlier.  The counter was wet in different places, had straw wrappers and crumbs on it and was dirty as well. Yuck. The bathroom doesn't even look clean. I really hope they can turn the situation around at this location because I really would like to be able to go there again.", "stars": 2.0}

Went right at noon. Found the experience very ordinary. Decided to order a Double Cheese Boyger, chilli cheese fries, and a vanilla shake. Was going to order separately but the kid working the counter tried to enter it as a combo and had to get assistance to ring me up. The price was the same as if I ordered separately so not sure why he didn't want to go that route.\n\nThen the wait began. Took about 15 mins to receive my food even though there were only a couple of tables that were there before me and not eating. I was not in a rush so it wasn't a huge deal.\n\nThe food itself was kinda blah. The chili on the chili cheese fries was very bland. So much so I actually had to add some ketchup to give it some flavor. Ketchup on chili cheese fries! Also the real ice cream milk shake was soupy and tasted very watered down. The highlight of the meal was the boyger which was decent. I would liken it to a Fatburger taste wise but more moist (which is the reason I don't go to Fatburger because I find their burgers dry). I ordered it with all the toppings. Was it enough to make me want to come back? Not really. I mean for a total of $13.64, I felt a double double animal style, animal fries, and shake from In N Out would have been much tastier and probably cheaper and faster.\n\nNOTE: if you are like me and don't like burgers that are really think and obscure the taste of condiments and bun, go with a single. By the time I got to the middle of the double boyger, all I could really taste was meat (thankfully it was tasty). I am not sure how the monster boyger or double monster compare but pretty sure if I do go back, I would just order a single.", "stars": 2.0}

I always order the same thing, vegetable Pho no mushrooms (which is usually delicious). Last night I ordered to-go about 15 minutes before closing time. I got home, made a bowl and was disgusted upon tasting it. It seemed maybe they were running low on broth since it was so close to closing and added water and oil to fill my to-go container. You could even see the oil separated in the container once it settled which I've never experienced with their broth before, something was obviously off. It was inedible, I threw the bowl I made away, called them and got no answer (which I figured since it was now past closing time at point)I was about to throw the remainder of it out until my roommate told me I should just return it. \n\nThe next day I did just that. The owner doubted me, it seemed as though she thought I was trying to get over on her (over just 10 freakin dollars) I searched \"Yama sushi\" in my bank app to show her the many times I've been there and the purchases of exactly $9.58 proving I always come there and order the same thing. I even showed her my call log to show I called last night and all she said was \"well I was here the time you called.\" Okay but you didn't answer so what's your point?? Anyways, she proceeded saying she couldn't give me a refund since it I ate some, I stated the bowl I did make for myself was in my trash and I threw it out after taking a couple bites because of the taste. She said I'd have to get it in order to get at refund... real ridiculous to make a customer go home and go through their garbage, right? When I returned, I did get refund but her attitude was VERY poor. She stated how much Pho she sold yesterday and nobody complained and how she doesn't think she'll ever sell me Pho again. She didn't apologize once. Her customer service sucks, her attitude is poor and she's an ugly bitch. Needless to say I won't be back. I will now stick to Pho Real for my Pho.", "stars": 2.0}

Described by Priceline as a 3-star hotel, its room rates have a typical upcharge for the exclusivity, $119/night, compared to cheaper rates for other hotels in its class. I scored a deal for $48/night off Priceline's \"name your own price,\" and I would not pay full rack rate.\n\nCheck-in was easy and painless, and I was assigned a room on the second floor. I was too tired from the drive in to think to ask for a room facing away from the road and the runway. I had no idea how close the airport runway was to the building -- another good reason to check Yelp in advance. Unless you find the roar of jet engines at all hours of the night soothing, you may find yourself sitting bolt upright in bed hearing a noisy roar that rattles the windows. Walls are also quite thin. I heard a baby crying and someone's television at odd hours. \n\nThe room itself was modern and attractive, with wavy wood floors throughout and a super-large king-sized bed. The desk is pressed up against the wall with a comfy white leatheresque padded chair, and a pair of overstuffed chairs face the TV on the wall. Watching TV from the bed wasn't very comfortable despite a mobile arm. The bathroom is large and bright, although the shower is equipped with only a glass half-wall. I worried about getting the tile floor all wet from a basic hair washing, and was glad I put down an extra towel. \n\nMake sure to check in before parking your car. Hotel Indigo locks the top floor access to the hotel to room keys, and I trudged over four floors in -11'C chill. There is no elevator service and the stairwells are badly marked. Dragging heavy luggage will not be fun but fortunately I had light carry-on. Parking costs $10/night, not a welcome addition atop the room charge. I suspect several people use park and fly services.

I check my receipt, it says blah blah blah XX days for return in original packaging blah blah blah. Great! I'm not stuck with a product I can never use and $35 out of my pocket.

And the way that the corporation of Toys R Us interprets the word \"underwear\" includes anything that touches the skin. Really.

I explain the situation and in a flurry of activity the woman runs over to a random display shelf, picks up a sign and comes back to me waving in front of me, repeating something the effect of \"i am regurgitating policy, this is what they tell me to say, even though i'm the manager, I still have no power\".

It's nowhere near where I got the product I was trying to return. #2 - the BELT, is neither underwear or a bra (which is clearly stated in brackets on the sign itself). Oh, I guess that depends on how you interpret underwear (which is a debate I got into with the executive offices). So the manager said she's done with me and hollers to the cashier to give me the customer service number and walks away. Woah.

A lot of corporate policy regurgitation as well, but I was prepared to stand my ground. It's principle and it's my money. They tried to tell me, that they'd make this grand exception and give me a gift card towards a future purchase. Ha! Are you kidding me? You're going to keep my money in the end anyway? Are you not listening to me? I have a registry there, and seven friends giving birth this year. Am I getting my piddly $35 bucks back or what?

Service was alright, although they mixed up a main order for one of my friends but he ended up liking the dish he got (cod) and they charged him for the cheaper dish he actually ordered (pork). I ordered the tortellini with rose sauce and my friend got the pesto penne. The food wasn't bad but we were both unimpressed (sauces were a bit bland and my pasta was a bit tough). The pasta tasted store bought and I felt I could have made it better at home. The portions were acceptable. My other friend got the manicotta and enjoyed it but his portion was rather small and he devoured it quickly. The restaurant is nice and has a good ambiance. It was full on a Saturday night.

When we got the DVD in the mail a few weeks later, I was a little disappointed as I looked through the shots.  Many of them looked very posed and unnatural (like a high school prom).  Perhaps this is more of an issue with the subjects than the photographer, but I feel like it is part of the photographer's job to help the subjects feel comfortable and natural.  There were also shots where one of our eyes were half closed, my hair was blowing in my face, etc.  We didn't have a particularly bad experience with B&W, but I wasn't that thrilled with the photos we got.\n\n(This is from a photo shoot we did in 2009).", "stars": 2.0}

{"review_id": "5_125", "text": "Absolutely terrible.  I went there to rent a property with showings by agent only.\n\nThe first time I asked to see the property, they gave me three agents.  2/3 said they no longer show properties for T.R. Lawing, and the last one did not respond to calls, texts, or voicemails.  I went back to T.R. Lawing about this, and they gave me three agent numbers again.  1/3 was an old number they gave me, once again, for an agent that doesn't show properties for T.R. Lawing.  The other two did not respond for days ...all too familiar.  I left continual messages, and finally reached one of them.\n\nAfter seeing the property, I submitted my application, and the leasing agent in charge of it did not process it quickly, claiming she was missing information.  I sent her the \"missing\" information, which really should've been in the application in the first place, so I wouldn't have to wait on her.  She didn't get back to me about the info for a few days, so I checked on her, and she told me that the property was just now rented by another applicant because she didn't process mine in time ...Are you serious?\n\nI talked to the real estate agent, and he said the owners were waiting so long for her to process my application, they lost hope in their rental and reconsidered an old rejected applicant.  They didn't even get a chance to see my offer..the one job T.R. Lawing has - to connect my application to the owner for both of our best interests.  They would've received their ask, and I would've rented a property in a timely manner; but now they had to settle for approving something they had not wanted. If T.R. Lawing had done their one job correctly, it would've been a win for all parties.  It's a shame.  \n\nAgain.. absolutely unacceptable, terrible management.  I understand why the agents no longer affiliate themselves with T.R. Lawing. T.R. Lawing literally influenced the owners to take the property off the market....while a prospective tenant tried to submit an application to rent their property...the complete opposite of their role.  Can you imagine your plumber clogging all of your toilets while you're gone?\n\nThe only reason they received a second star is because at least they had the property I wanted to rent in the first place.. if only they had made it possible to rent.", "stars": 2.0}

However, something happened recently that may change my mind. I brought my dry cleaning in on Friday, April 12, 2013 and it's always ready the next day after 5:00, which is definitely a plus. So I picked up my clothes on Monday evening after work only to find out they had laundered, not dry cleaned, all of my expensive work shirts. I always leave explicit instructions to NOT launder my shirts as they have strechy material in them and will shrink and fade. Typically they reassure me that they wouldn't ever do that; however, this time they did. I was devastated when I picked them up. I was very poilte. The gentleman apologized and informed me they have several new people working there which may have been why this happened. I left the store with my dry cleaning hoping and praying my shirts were okay. Come to find out the next morning when I put one of them on, they had shrunk. They no longer fit my arms and I look like I'm trying to fit into a child's shirt. I called that day (which wasTuesday), spoke to someone and informed them of what had happened. I was told I would receive a call back in 20 minutes. I did not hear from anyone that day, so I called back the next morning. Again I was told that someone will call me back. It is now Thursday, I have a closet full of shrunken dress shirts and I still have not heard back from anyone.\n\nI'm writing this review in hopes of someone at Delia's realizing that you can't just ignore unhappy customers.

{"review_id": "5_169", "text": "When we started taking the YRT bus to work about 8 years ago there was a regular super driver every morning; the bus was never too hot or too cold and he never ran those horrendous deafening high speed fans blowing hot air or freezing a/c.  The driver allowed the heat of the engine + the volume of passengers to heat the bus allowing natural convection.  The ride was quiet and comfortable.  He only ran the a/c on hot humid days and would run the fan on low. On temperate non humid days we enjoyed open windows and fresh air.   In those days riding the YRT was very relaxing and the service was much appreciated.  Our bus route is usually on time, but although buses running on time is very important it is not the only factor that will encourage riders to ditch or park their cars and take the bus. \nFast forward a few years and our nice driver retired.  There is a different driver every morning (ditto return trip at 5pm) and each and every one of them insist on running a high speed fan spewing freezing air in summer, and either hot or cold air in winter...according to the driver's whim.  the driver sits comfortably in his cotton blouse, no jacket or anorak...his window open...enjoying the hot or freezing air from behind...ignoring the confort of his passengers who are cannot enjoy their music on their Bluetooth because it is too booking loud.  Passengers also subjected to dry skin, dry eyes, nose bleeds and frequent unrelenting respiratory infections because of the moisture sucking high speed fans.  Have always lived in one city or another.  Always been a fan of public transit; wish I could give the YRT the 3 or 4 stars that it's rider's deserve to enjoy.  Too bad YRT supports the whims of its drivers instead of the comfort and enjoyment of its passengers.  It seems the YRT  does not give a damn about increasing ridership.", "stars": 2.0}

I got a pedicure and gel manicure from the younger guy and I honestly thought he was just the salon \"helper\" because all the other times I had come in he was just sitting in a desk in a corner tending to his farm on Facebook. The pedicure was mediocre and lasted only about 10 min total which is entirely too short for a \"deluxe pedi.\" What really upset me was during my gel mani, I asked him to file my nails in an \"almond\" shape. He had no idea what meant. I tried to describe it to him and even pulled up a picture from Pinterest. He looked at me and said that's round. He then grabbed my phone and showed it to the person next to him as he proceeded to mock me and say that it's so annoying when people walk in with Pinterest pictures and expect them to replicate the designs. According to him those designs are all \"photoshopped\" and aren't actually possible to make. All of this because I asked for a shape! And that is the reason why I will not be returning to 4D Nails.

{"review_id": "5_219", "text": "My daughter did the triple threat Twinkles program and also private singing lessons at the Summerlin location and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Hands down, the best thing about it was the teachers who were always patient, kind and pleasant with my daughter. Unfortunately,  we will not be returning because of the manager Mary Klein. Mary is terribly and obviously unhappy, unprofessional, miserable, irritable and rude on almost every occasion I had the displeasure of dealing with her. Despite the overall quality of my child's experience with the teachers, I can't risk my daughter being subjugated to Mary's dark disposition in the future. This programs requires a 6 month contract and parents are not permitted to have eyes on their child for the duration of the class as it could be a distraction. While I understand the intention, this leaves a zero margin for error and wouldn't expect anything less than stellar customer service and interactions with ALL the staff with parents and children: a foundation of trust. A person like Mary who responds to benign program based questions with sarcastic and dismissive tone is the absolute worst thing for a business dealing with children. I am absolutely confused as to why she doesn't find a different job because she is clearly overwhelmed and ill-equipped with the personality traits that mirror the otherwise joyful and creative atmosphere they are trying to project at Hollywood Kids. In short, she is the weakest link. Despite her abhorrent behavior, it is unlikely she will be removed from the position because she is friend's with the owner.

{"review_id": "5_227", "text": "Nancy seemed nice when I met her while applying for one of the properties that Go Global manages, however, the company she works for is shady and greedy. They took my money while I was trying to orchestrate an across the country move from Boston to Las Vegas. They did not prepare the unit at all, in fact it appeared to have been abandoned and potentially broken into between my viewing the unit and us arriving on the first day of the lease. \n\nWe had no choice but to move our possessions in since we could not afford to nor could the moving company delay the drop off that was prearranged. Upon first notifying the company of the issues with the property, we were told to give their handy man the complete list and everything would be tended to. However, the agent, Harry Lee, then notified us that \"the owner denied repair\". They \"fixed\" a handful of $20 repairs and neglected to remedy the real problem or cause of any of the issues. Even the cleaning they provided (5 days into the lease) did not allow adequate time for the cleaning service to clean the whole house. This was due to the fact that the entire home was covered in caked on dirty and grease, with calcium deposits and mold and mildew on the fixtures, and electrical outlets were broken and not properly installed. \n\nIt became clear the company had no intention of repairing the unit and it is becoming clearer that they plan to take as much of our money as possible with no regard for our health, safety, or well-being as tenants or human beings. Even in compromising to end the lease, our deposit is being held hostage while we are searching for a new home.\n\nI've never been so routinely disregarded in any capacity. It is clear this company runs on greed and neglects it's clients. I cannot fully judge Nancy as she was not directly responsible for the management of the property and I do not have a direct relationship with her outside meeting her at the time of application. However, the company itself is one of the worst I've ever encountered and staying at a place like that, in an industry that relies so heavily on relationships and networking, I would say if she retains long-term relations with the company then she is likely to be as bad as everyone else I've encountered at Go Global.

I have always had decent service and great food...\nOn Mother's Day, I had returned from a trip to L.A. and my wife wanted one thing for Mother's Day...NAKAMA. We went and they were not busy (as in most cases) and we sat down to order. I have a Passport Card, and usually get two-for-one items which keep the price down nicely. There was no happy hour as it was Mother's Day, and I guess I can live with that. I also had a check-in reward for a free edamame from Yelp.\nWe were promptly informed that \"because of our Mothers Day Special, we cannot honor the Passport card tonight\". I asked about the special and it was a $30 plate that would probably have cost less ordered any other day.\nI decided we would deal with it and asked for our edamame to get started. We were told \"we are not honoring that tonight\". At that point, I was frustrated and a bit tired from a long trip and got up to leave. On the way out, the manager said \"I don't want to let you guys walk out of here unhappy...Nobody honors specials on Mother's Day\". I replied \"I will bet Tomo does\" and we paid for the Diet Coke and left. We had a great meal at a nearby mexican restaurant and all is well.\nAll that being said, I love this place. The food is always good, but the fact that something so stupid as a free $4 appetizer was not covered for regular customers is somewhat unsettling to me. Maybe it is that I am whining about a free appetizer, but my point is that you just cannot find REALLY good customer service as readily anymore. The manager said he recognized us and STILL refused to even consider doing us a small favor in return for our repeat business. Not letting us walk out would have gone a LONG way.\nWill we return??

So after checking in to my hotel, I went there around 6p on a week night.  The place was about half full.  I was quickly seated for 1.  The interior looked nice and had table cloth...upgrade from typical Vietnamese restaurants that I've experienced.\n\nThe waiter brought water and menu, but then he left.  There were 2 of them, and one of them appeared to be the owner perhaps.  As the menu is mostly in French with simple English, it took me some time to decide.  The food is more of an Asian fusion than the typical Vietnamese restaurant.  But during this whole time, I was ignored and the waiter never came back to check on me until I waive him over, which was about 10min later.  Again, this place is only about half full, so it wasn't as if he's busy.\n\nWhen he came over, the order was taken quickly, which I ordered the basic shrimp spring roll and the beef pho (I think they only had 2 or 3 different type of pho, and rest is other stuff that I have no idea).  My food came within 10min, so that was fine.  Overall, I thought the flavor was very basic and had some sort of shrimp or seafood taste (probably more MSG).  Again, this is supposed to be beef pho.  I ended up putting some hoisin sauce and hot sauce as the soup didn't have much depth to it.  To be honest, the food was OK, about a 2-3 stars.  Reason I've decided on 2 star is due to lack of service.  \n\nNow, this part I do have to explain a little.  Again, there were 2 waiters working.  One was quiet, and the other was more flamboyant and talkative as he was laughing and joking with several other customers.  But when he came over to take my order, it was short and quiet.  Now, you could say I was probably the only non-speaking French customer there, or that I was the only Asian customer?  So maybe he doesn't like other Asians or me personally?  Either way, I certainly didn't feel very welcome there and felt discriminated.  When I asked for the bill, the waiter told me to just go to the front desk.  Once again, it was the same cold treatment w/o saying thank you, a smile, or any other gesture.  \n\nSo yes, I can see how others may have given this place a high review, but I guess I don't fit the profile of their typical customer.", "stars": 2.0}

And the people are nice.  But after having had 1 lesson before we came to them then 3 consecutive lessons with Charlotte aquatics my kids still can't swim.  I just got notice that they wanted them to go into level 2A for the third time.  To me if you can't teach a kid something after 2 times in the same level why pay again for it!   My neighbor has a pool that Im afraid my kids will get into and I WANTED them swimming by the summer but over $800 later and they are still not swimming enough to move on to the next level.  There are too many tragedies close to my family with children and pools and I think going too slow leaves them vulnerable.\n\nThe lessons themselves are very short, and there are 2 teachers.  One works with each child one on one while the other just watches the others at the side of the pool.  So there is a lot of wasted time- perhaps while one teacher is working one on one the other could have them all holding on and practicing going underwater, or kicking while holding the side of the pool.... something!  Just no down time, its already a short lesson and I think most parents are like me and doing if for their kids safety around water.  No time for a slow pace when their lives are at stake. \n\nI will say that my son is a typical boy who isn't all that interested in swimming properly and is a little lazy and would rather goof off.  But thats why I got the lessons and spent $800!  I hoped they would have clever ways to get them engaged and teach them faster and more efficiently.  My son needs a little pushing -not a snails pace.\n\n  I let them know I was frustrated and again they were nice, but didn't solve it.  I guess the only thing that would have made me happy is \"your right, this is moving a bit slow\"  lets move them on to the next level and the next session is on us.  But thats kinda a dream world solution :) There was a bunch of back and forth, to busy to call me...wanted me to come in for another assessment..more delay and slowness instead of a \" Ill solve this for you, lets get your kids swimmingASAP.\" \n\nThey do have a very specific plan for teaching the kids and are great about focusing on safety.

The owner Tammy is great, every else that works there is not", "stars": 2.0}

It's a nice looking place that's well designed for that \"fun, late night food\" feeling but I've unfortunately always left Smoke's disappointed. On their menu the list of toppings and combinations they have sound really good, but no matter how many of them I've tried they've always tasted bland. Case and point, recently got a poutine that had \"prime rib beef\" but it was all grey coloured, overcooked ground beef. I don't see any reason you would waste prime rib meat by cooking it that way. Their fries are so/so, never quite crispy enough on the outside, or soft enough on the inside, their curds and sauce lack a lot of taste. I also find their to-go boxes make sure all the gravy drowns out the fries at the bottom so they get really soggy, fast. At this point I think I'm done going back to this place and would encourage anyone who loves poutine to try somewhere else.", "stars": 2.0}

Although our cashier was friendly enough, and accurate in taking our order, several miscues that followed dampened this dining experience.  \n\nRealizing it might be difficult to obtain, Diane and I nevertheless asked for our burgers to be prepared as medium rare as possible.  A cook then came out to tell us that per corporate policy the meat has to remain cooking until it reaches 155 degrees.  I nodded that I understood, and then within about a minute our burgers were produced.  \n\nWhat?  There was no time to have cooked them fresh after our brief encounter, so it is obvious that these dry and utterly well done burger patties (mine for a Sourdough Jack, and Diane's for a Bacon Ultimate Cheese Burger) had been prepared ahead of our order, and then all ingredients quickly cobbled together.  And, although my order of Curly Fries was present, my order of a Monster Taco was noticeably missing from the two plastic trays holding our food.\n\nBack to the counter to report the missing taco, and it was swiftly supplied.  So, we sat down to eat, and I noticed that some of my fries were congealed together, while Diane asked me to get her some salt.  When I tried to find a packet or two at the condiment bar, I ran into two cups of pepper packets but no salt at all.  So back to the counter to report this, and the friendly cashier went to the back of the kitchen and returned with a few packages of salt for Diane.\n\nSo, now were we finally ready and well equipped to eat our late dinner?  Unfortunately, not quite.  For, as Diane prepared to dig into her cheesy Bacon Cheddar Wedges, she noticed that she had no fork.  Back to the condiment bar I went, looking for a plastic fork.  Yes, you guessed it; there were none visible.  Nor a knife or spoon.  So, back to the counter I went to ask for a plastic fork, which was soon produced by the cashier in a plastic package that also contained a plastic knife and a plastic spoon.  \n\nAt last we were able to eat our meals.

The girl that did my nails seemed professional at the beginning and gave me ample amounts of time to choose my color, I ended up going with OPI's Bubble Bath in their Gel Formula. \n\nWhen it came to prepping, I asked her to keep my length and not file it down too much, and if possible not file at all. This was because at the time, I was growing out my nails and didn't want to shorten them seeing as I was fine with different lengths on different fingers. She seemed weirded out and said that it would look strange the way my nails were. \"Oh it's alright, I'm trying to grow them out so I don't want to lose any length if possible\" was my response.\n\nShe proceeded to file and buff them. My thumb nail was fairly short due to a break at the time and the length could have been salvaged by just filling away the tiny chip. But to even it out with my other hand, she filed all the way down and essentially hit skin. She then used a buffing block too roughly and managed to cut a cuticle on one of my fingers so they were sore from all the rough surface buffing. \n\nAfter she was done, my nail polish looked .... ugh. It was a bit too thick, making my nails look obviously fake and 'blocky' (it looked like 5-6 layers...thick layers.) and I really wasn't pleased.\n\nIt lasted almost a week before it started peeling.

The wedges we got were stale. It tasted like it was the last scoop of the old batch. Our friends got a new batch (took a while after ours to come out).

We hadn't been back in a while and it was very disappointing this time. I understand this chain was bought out recently. It has definitely gone down hill since. I started with a one-star review but will concede to two because the food was edible. Though a tiny bit pricy for a casual restaurant, our experience was average at best. My chicken was obviously overcooked and very dry. The steak tips were fine. Though I didn't ask why, I did notice that one of our friends ate very little of here meatloaf. None of us ate our grilled vegetables as they were remarkably tough and tasteless. Though presentation isn't everything it is important when you've taken your guests somewhere... everything on the plates just looked messy. All this after the waitress flipped a glass of wine onto the table, onto our guests, their clothing, and purse. We realize this was an accident and a sincere apology would have sufficed but the waitresses comment was \"I've been doing this for two years and I've never done that before\". She seemed to think it was funny. Neither was she in any hurry to assist us cleaning up, she just stood there. We had to ask for extra napkins and a wet cloth to wipe wine off the ruined shirt and purse. I was thoroughly embarrassed to have brought people here and it goes without saying that I'll never do it again. My guess is that Claim Jumper is on it's way out.

Anyways, we went back and they grilled us about confusing things we didn't really understand like what kind of tofu we wanted and if we wanted sauce. We chose brown because we're stupid and sat down and waited for our tofu. The chef brought it out to us and I took a bite second, fearlessly.

Isn't their goal to sell you a dress? I liked the collection they had, so i decided to return with a group of friends (they limit you to about 4 guests), since  my friends encouraged me to try on more than 5 dresses, the assistant was outnumbered and had to bring me more. It's an important day and the having a nice dress matters to me. If i'm going to spend a couple of thousand dollars on it, I believe I reserve the right to try on as many as I please. They also don't want to reveal the designer names of their dresses, but you can easily find them online. In the end, I did not purchase a dress from them because I didn't find what I was looking for. Maybe my dream dress was hanging somewhere on their racks, but I never found out as they kept limiting the number of dresses they wanted me to try on (and I'm referring to only 15 dresses total).

As you can see by my previous review below, I really liked this place when I visited in November of 2015.  My visit this evening started off bad and didn't get much better.\n\nWhen I arrived, there was one seat remaining at the bar.  The lounge/dining area was almost empty, so I decided to just wait for a seat.  After standing there for 3 or 4 minutes the barmaid said she would be with me in a moment (there were a total of 3 employees working the bar/lounge).  Another 2 minutes went by and she told me to just sit wherever I wanted.  I sat at a bar table directly across from the center of the bar...for 20 to 25 minutes waiting for ANYBODY to wait on me.  The original barmaid walked past me 5 times, bringing food to the guy sitting next to me and drinks to others around me.  I thought maybe I wasn't sitting in her section and someone else might be at fault.  Finally, I got her attention and asked if I could get a menu.  She brought me a menu and didn't even offer me a drink still.  I should have realized the service was going to be terrible and left at this point, but I was hungry and my previous two experiences were at this place were very good.  I was able to order a water, soup and salmon with a side of fruit about 5 minutes later.  It took 10 minutes for her to bring my water, another 20 minutes from that point to get the soup and then another 10 minutes for the salmon and instead of fruit I got vegetables.  The potato and chicken soup was just okay this visit--it had a different flavor.  The asked for the salmon to be prepared medium and it came out completely raw in the center, although the flavor was decent for the portions around the edge that were cooked properly.  However, the vegetables that I did not order were delicious!  I decided to order brownie desert since I didn't quite eat all of my food and she informed me they were out of ice cream.  I just chuckled at that point.  I hope this terrible experience is simply the result of a poor group of employees working on this particular night.  If it weren't for my previous experience I would have wanted to give this place a negative rating!  I am not sure I will risk coming back unless I see a different group of employees working.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nThere are very few hotel meals that I would ever take the time to rate. My meals at Libations this week were amazing! \n\nThe Potato & Chicken soup is one of the best soups I have ever tasted. I had a cup on Monday and I was considering ordering a second cup after my meal came.  However, the salmon I ordered for my main course was also incredible and I did not have room for any more deliciousness.\n\nI decided to come back on Wednesday to get some more potato and chicken. This time I ordered a bowl and slammed it! So awesome! There were many good choices on the menu so I decided to try the fish and chips this time.  The fish didn't knock me off my feet, but it was still good.\n\nI can't wait until my next Charlotte trip so I can get some more soup and maybe try some other items on this menu.\n\nBMarkus", "stars": 2.0}

Apparently Mondays are sushi nights so I figured I'd just get a couple of rolls. I went with rainbow connection and dragon. I don't know if the ingredients weren't fresh or what it was but the rolls just fell flat. Really lacking in flavor and just overall disappointing.

I did the white rice, beans and chicken stew. The white rice was blander than expected and the beans really helped add a nice flavor element, so I dumped them over the rice. I have never ordered the chicken stew, I usually order the beef stew, but since I'm watching my figure and the chicken stew looked so good, I gave it a shot. Big mistake, the stew was riddeled with bones, big ones, little ones, baby ones, every kind of bone imaginable. It's true, by cooking the stew with the bones in (they clearly put the WHOLE bird in) it adds a ton of natural flavor. I just had no idea upon ordering what I had got myself into.

It was interesting to see how other people who came in after myself, retrieved their orders quickly. I also ordered the scallion pancake which came out in a timely manner.

{"review_id": "5_353", "text": "I'd like to start out by saying, there are a lot of things Bridges at Mallard Creek does right. The pools are typically clean, and the complimentary gym, although lacking equipment, is obviously a plus.\n\nWith that being said, this apartment complex community is split into 2 different communities. One community is pretty nice, with 3+ bedrooms and very nice interior. The other community has 1980's cabinets, and is pretty run down. Spacious, and attractive floor plan, but run down. You can call one the NICE community and the other, the SHIT community...and guess what folks...I live in the SHIT community.\n\nAdditionally, these apartments are maintenance nightmares, we have lived here for 5 months and have put in 7 work orders for various things like leaking toilet, doors falling off hinges, no cold water for the washing machine, A/C being broken...etc. I completely agree with the other review, on how the apartments have some severe leakage. Our utilities bill is stupid high for no reason, me and my wife work all day, and hardly use the AC when we are home, but our bill is 160 a month AND RISING. It makes no damn sense.\n\nThe worst part of Bridges at Mallard Creek has got to be the leasing agents. Now, they may all very well be good people, BUT there is no organization or communication throughout them and there is a clear lack of leadership and policy knowledge. If you ask a question, you are very likely to get a different answer from all of them.\n\nThe apartments come with a washer and dryer (but no microwave....not sure how that makes any sense) and the ones in out apartment were staining our clothes. I had originally asked a leasing consultant if I could have my washer and dryer swapped with theirs, and was told no. Once we realized that their washer and dryer were ruining our clothes, I called and asked again, this time I spoke to a different agent who informed me that this would be no problem at all. I specifically asked her to call and verify with maintenance that this would not be an issue. The leasing agent called me back and informed me that they are willing and able to swap the machines for us. When the maintenance guy showed up, he said he was told that he was there to fix a washer machine. He had no idea he would be removing a washer and dryer, and putting ours in. \n\nAnother fine example, our scan card to enter the pool area and gym stopped working. When we informed the leasing agent, she told us we would have to pay for a new one (Even though the card was damaged when we received it). When we went down the next day, a different leasing agent swapped the card for free. Now most people do not complain about not having to pay for something, but this further shows the lack of communication between the leasing agents, as well as my growing frustration with this company. And whose to say the idiot that wanted us to pay for a new card wasn't going to throw the 10 bucks in her purse??? It makes you question the ethics and morals of the agents.\n\nWe moved in March 30th, and have paid for our rent with personal check ever since. Last month my wife goes to drop off the rent check and she is told they do not accept personal checks. My wife asks when they started that policy and she was told October...OF LAST YEAR. how does that make any sense? we have been paying with a personal check for 4 months but apparently there has been this policy in place before we even moved in?! Obviously this wasn't adding up. My wife questioned the policy, and the leasing agent went to speak to her manager. The 2 ladies were speaking loud enough for my wife to hear them, and the manager told the leasing agent \"we can accept personal checks, but we'd prefer not too, so tell her she needs to pay online\". What kind of shit is that?! It is just absolutely frustrating, so now we need to go out of our ways to enroll in the online payment process... it's just bad customer service. Especially considering we both have credit scores of over 700 and have never bounced a check. \n\nYou never know which one of the leasing agents is telling the truth. They respond to questions based on convenience rather than customer service. Me and my wife are very easy people to please, but when you get the run-around every single time you encounter the leasing agents, it definitely gets under your skin. I'd recommend a different apartment complex, something more updated, and professional... and don't even get me started about the tiny ass staircases the SHIT community has, it is nearly impossible to move any bulky furniture in, and it obviously gets damaged in the process of moving in due to the stairs being so confining.", "stars": 2.0}

My main gripe was the actual haircut itself. I don't expect royal treatment for a 14 dollar haircut, but my head has never been treated as roughly as it was last week, and I've spent many years in full contact sports. Perhaps the lady was having a bad day or was at the end of her shift, but she came at my hair like it had done her a personal wrong. My requested haircut was simple, clippers on the back and sides and scissors on top, but she basically attacked my head. Since you can't ~really~ mess up clippers the back and sides of my head are fine, though she was a bit overzealous with the tool, and she cleaned up my sideburns very nicely: they're completely even. But she went over the top and front with scissors with such rapid ferociousness that I was worried she would just start ripping out my hair. The end result didn't look terrible, but is definitely much lower quality than the first time I came to this location (I've been to the North Olmsted one and never returned after one of their barbers butchered my hair as well). The hair right further back on top of my head is almost just as long as it was when I came in, and the front is not particularly even.

While the brand changes slightly to accommodate the local clientele and culture, one thing that stays fairly consistent is the Starbucks customer service model of making your drink the right way in a timely manner and doing with exceptional customer service. \n\nThis Starbucks location is not the best when it comes to delivering an amazing experience to the customer.\n\nThe baristas are abrasive and the service is not speedy. I tend to order brewed coffee with a side of ice water and something to eat (usually a bagel or lemon pound cake). The brewed coffee is fairly quick but I was amazed at how long it took to throw a bagel into the toaster and return it! After standing and tracking my bagel on the next visit, I noticed that it was sitting in this food line after leaving the toaster getting cold. Has anyone thought about designating a batista to be assigned to simply hand food to the already paid and waiting customer? I don't have to work as a batista to understand that there's a problem with this supply chain.\n  \nI've visited this location several times prior to writing this review with an attempt to see \"another perspective\" but my perception remains the same.", "stars": 2.0}

But again it was very big.

It's frustrating because I love my ring and can't enjoy wearing it. I feel weird on my finger, which never happened with any of my other rings from other stores.\n\nSo, as jewerlers, I can't say they're good at resizing a ring.

I left voicemails and emails for two days and heard nothing back. The loan was then denied and when I called again, I was treated as if I was stupid for not understanding and wasting their time.

I needed access to my credit card statements from a past year.

{"review_id": "5_419", "text": "*IF YOU ARE A REGIONAL MANAGER, PLEASE READ* The two stars are only because of how good the salads are, but that's the point of a food establishment, so maybe I'll go with 1.5 stars. I've been to this location 4 times since it opened, and there were various problems every time (used wrong dressing, small things like that. It's clear that many of the employees have not been trained well, through no fault of their own. I sincerely hope a regional manager sees this; the mangers at this location are either lazy, clueless, apathetic, or careless. Today was the day I decided that I at least wanted to get my voice out there. There were three women in front of me, and four behind me. There was one employee putting the salads together, and one chopping and at the cash register at the same time. If I knew the names of these two, I would commend them on their excellent service and attitudes. The girl had never chopped a salad there, but she jumped in to help and she did a great job. At this point, it had already been 7 minutes bc two women in front changed their minds and decided to get wraps. That's fair, indecisive customers are to be expected. The manager was interviewing a guy literally looking STRAIGHT AHEAD at the now 8 person long line. Didn't blink an eye. I have been a host, a server, a bartender, and in retail for over 6 years. Every time I've interviewed at restaurants, the manager had to get up for a minute or two to help out the employees of it got busy. A woman in the back of the line went up to that manager and told her how unprofessionally this was going, and, reluctantly, the manager got up by the cash register. We also noticed (us in line were griping together- again not at the two working, they were great) another manager get up from sitting in the back to run the other register and clearly she was not happy about it. I know she could have been on break, but as a manager, her job is to MANAGE situations like this. Honestly, the four people behind me should not have even been charged. It was a 15 minute situation. These managers need to get their acts together and understand their job is to train employees well, manage the place (its literally their job title), and care about service. Again, I've been in customer service for a long time, and I've witnessed the good the bad and the ugly. This was both bad and made ugly by the unprofessional managers.

My first visit, approx 6 months ago (to fulfill my bi-annual craving), was equally underwhelming but I thought I'd give them another shot. Food was mediocre at best. They were offering complimentary soup, which would have been great if it was actually good soup. The \"hostess\" or whomever she was (not wearing the wait staff attire and taking money at the register) sat across from me for at least 20 minutes gossiping and gabbing to another co-worker at the front of the restaurant. There was a \"booth barrier\" between us, but she was still annoying. Also - my waitress, one of only two who were working, (she was good otherwise, however, all things considered) must have gotten sidetracked because I sat there for at least 15 minutes with my plate pushed back and a napkin over it (signaling I was done, since the typical 10/4 o'clock position of the flatware wasn't working).

Now I'm not a doctor, but if I can feel and see physically that my throat is inflamed (it was actually obvious),  it's no typical flu. The doctor (who shall not be named) was TERRIBLE. SHE just advise me to take Advil and Tylenol so the swelling would go away. She took a swab of my throat to determine whether I need antibiotics. Mind you that I cannot talk because of the extreme swelling of my throat. As a non medical physician,  obviously I would took her advise (doctor knows best right) . She also told me that she would contact me in two days to find out the results. The pain lingered on for another day and I couldn't take it anymore so I decided to go to a different clinic to get another input. Dr. Youseff who does NOT work at any local appletree clinic was friendly,  kind hearted woman who informed me that I actually have a virus that needs to be addressed asap.

The first room I was given was on the 3rd floor. It was so gross that I was planning on sleeping in a sweatshirt. The bathroom... omg... the sink was broken, filled with rust stains, and the hot water didn't turn on. The mirror was cracked, as was the floor tiles. The bathtub was TINY, and it was so nasty. It had deep rust stains, thick soap scum (like as if it hasn't been cleaned), and multiple hairs stuck all over. There was also a roach behind the toilet. The bed area was dingy - only one light worked, old box tv, dust all over (like thick and visible), and it looked like something out of a 1970's horror film. \n\nI called down to the front desk and asked if some of the rooms have been renovated. She said no, but she said I was welcome to come down and look at some other rooms. I did that and ended up on the first floor. The room was far from nice (and good luck sleeping with the street noise outside), and it was not renovated either, but it was MUCH cleaner and brighter than the first room. \n\nOnce we settled in I turned on the air conditioning unit. Within a few minutes it started to smell. This was not like a musty, old smell. This was like a smell that was somewhere between sardines and a dirty c*otch (sorry, but that's the truth). So we turned off the air and let the smell clear. Then at night the noise started. Apparently the walls are VERY thin (so thin that they actually have a sign outside asking people to be quiet at night because they know people can hear). Let's just say that the couple staying next to us seemed to really enjoy the hour between midnight and 1am. At one point I started banging a water bottle against the wall, but then I just heard them giggle and then carry on 10 seconds later.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was nothing special.

{"review_id": "5_466", "text": "Right around 5 weeks I started to notice a flat spot forming on our LO, my husband however thought I was crazy.  I had been going to PT as I developed pregnancy induced CT and mentioned it to my therapist, who gave me some helpful tips on at home stretches.  The flat spot continued to get worse; therefore, at his 8 MO well baby I brought it up to his pediatrician who confirmed plagiocephaly and referred us to a pediatric PT.  The following week, our son was evaluated and found to have not only plagiocephaly but also brachiocephaly; both were believed to be a result of in utero torticollis.  Given the severity, she did not believe his head shape and ear shift would resolve with PT alone; even though his pediatrician recommended waiting until 6 months, his PT thought no harm in looking into this sooner.  Stretches and PT continued but we were proactive and scheduled a consultation with Cranial Tech at 3.5 MOs.  As a parent who has worked in the medical industry for more than 15 years, including billing, I did my homework; I contacted Cranial Tech to obtain the CPT/ICD-9/10 codes, called my insurance company to determine what our responsibility would be based on such codes and inquired to anything further related to prior authorization etc.  Our consultation roles around, a few days later a report is received confirming the severity of his \"flat spots\" and we are given the choice to proceed; my husband and I agreed, absolutely let's be aggressive and start treatment ASAP.  With this being said, the billing department submitted all of the necessary information to my insurance company to obtain prior authorization.  About a week later, we receive a call from a representative in the billing department who was very thorough and walked us through what we thought was everything; plus, we had already done our homework so there should be no surprises, until he outgrew his band and needed a second one!  Our son received his first doc band shortly before the Thanksgiving holiday and was about to outgrow it right before the end of the year.  His clinician, Barb, was great throughout his entire treatment; even towards the end when we all thought the chances he would need a second band were high, we were proactive and ready to initiate the process (i.e. images, eval, and obtain prior authorization) before the end of the year so that we wouldn't have to pay the deductible/OOP again.  Unfortunately, after much back and forth, the billing department at Cranial Tech informed us that our insurance company is the only company which requires your child be in a doc band for 8 weeks/2 months before s/he can be evaluated for a second band.  Go figure, it is the end of 2015 and our child had only been in a band for ~6 weeks.  My quam with Cranial Tech is that they knowingly admitted after the fact that our insurance company is the only one that they have seen with this requirement; if that is the case then, why not give us all of the necessary information before we pulled the trigger allowing us to make an educated decision given our situation?  We understand that they would never recommend delaying treatment and the sooner you begin the better but at least if we were given that information then, we could've decided if we want to take that chance now or wait until January.  As I mentioned, we did our due diligence and went into it completely aware of our responsibility, not a problem, but now our son needs a second band and we don't have the means to come up with the $ for another deductible/OOP just 10 weeks after paying for the first one.  Cranial Tech failed to properly educate us as parents, considering they were aware of this one off with our insurance company is very frustrating.  This is not a typical question to ask your insurance company, \"what if our child needs a second band, do you have any strange requirements\".  Of course we know that when a new year roles around your deductible starts over; however, our son could've been fitted for a second band in the same year and thus, the need to pay additional funds OOP would've been moot.  I will say that the original clinician (don't recall her name) who conducted our consultation did not elude to a possibility of him outgrowing his band in less than 6 weeks either.  Ultimately, I would not recommend Cranial Tech to other parents; their prices are more than double their other local competitor and it is the same thing.  In addition, they don't proactively provide you with information unless you ask for it.  The only positive thing about the experience was his clinician, Barb.  His head shape is definitely better but his ear shift is still very pronounced and he could definitely benefit from a second band, just wish we had the means to do right by our son.", "stars": 2.0}

Bummer, 'cause it was a gorgeous evening, but it WAS Bike Week.  So we sat at the bar to have cocktails---we were told we'd be seated in about 10 minutes.  Good, we're hungry.\n\nAt 6.30, one of our DC's (DC=Dining Companion) went and lassoed the young hostess, who said \"five minutes more\".  Ten minutes later, DC went back in AGAIN and she must have been firm, because the hostess came out to collect us, only to pause and then say: \"Oh, wait, there's another table I need to seat first.\"  DC nailed her with a steely glare and the child gulped and led us into the dining room, where only half the tables were occupied.  (WTH?)\n\nWe should have stayed out at the bar and just drank.  Walking into that dining room was like walking into a wall of heat.  And there was a chemically smell---the other of our DC;s, a former builder, guessed it was whatever finishing product they used on the (very attractive) back wall of reclaimed wood.  I mean the restaurant looks very nice.  You can tell they did it on a budget, but I actually like that better than an over-the-top place (plus there are ideas I can steal, heeheehee)\n\nOur waitress came.

DC #1 ordered the chicken parm and a dinner salad, DC #2 ordered The Bartlett Pizza and dinner salad, DH ordered a pepperoni and onion pizza and dinner salad and I ordered the Tuscan Risotto and Caesar salad.\n\nSalads came out pretty promptly, were fresh, but again, nothing special.  Just nicely dressed salads, fresh, with decent dressing.\n\nEntrees arrived in a timely manner as we finished our salads---nice pacing.  Unfortunately...  DC #2's pizza was dead cold.  On the other hand, DH's pie was bubbling hot and he said it was pretty darn good.  (Is their new pizza oven too small to bake two pizzas at once?)  So The Bartlett was sent back to the kitchen for a reheat and DC #2 urged us to go ahead and eat so our food didn't get cold.  \n\nLike I said, DH liked his pizza.  He said he would put it on the positive side of a 1-10 scale---maybe a 6.5-7?  DC #1's chicken parm---well, the chicken was well cooked, but the tomato sauce ladled over it was very acidic---not well balanced at all, and DC #1 did not like it.  Oddly enough, the spaghetti that was the side was tossed with an entirely different sauce that was actually pretty good!  (I tasted both sauces and there was a very noticeable difference!) As for my Tuscan Risotto.  I really should have sent it back, it was so disgusting.  Look, if someone back in the kitchen had a lick of sense, it could have been a delicious dish---sausage, green and red peppers, onions, and, of course, arborio rice.  The rice was really well cooked.  Tender but with some bite.  But there was so much cheese mixed into the risotto it was a nasty, greasy mess (see photo---that yellow blob about six o'clock on my plate is a puddle of grease), and once my meal started to cool, all that cheese started globulifying and it was just...gross.  I think I ended up eating scarcely 1/5 of a $22 dinner, once I had removed enough and all that yellow-y grease started oozing.  Like I said, I should have returned it. Instead, I actually allowed Nice Server to box it!  (What was I thinking?) As for DC #2, when his re-heated pizza was brought out to him, it was now hot, but dried out.  He ate one piece and then had it boxed---he probably did what I did, which is just dropped the carry-out container into the garage garbage can when I got home.  \n\nI am not sure why I am giving this place 2 stars, except DH liked his pizza and our server was such a sweetie.

Turns out it was our waitress and she did not look too happy.\n\nLet's get to the nitty gritty- what was good:\nwhole catfish (minus the head even though I would've liked it with) moist inside and crunchy outside.\nbaked beans were AWESOME! even for someone like me to hates beans\nHalf chicken was decent, nice flavor but some parts were pretty dry\nTurnip greens were good\n\nThe not so good:\nOur waitress was very helpful but was so slow and at times we had to have the other wait staff find her for us\nMy man had the peach tea...it was a little on the tangy side ( uh its supposed to be peach, not lemon tea)\nMini cornbread, dry and a little hard\nLots of other customers complaining and wanting to talk to the manager due to the kitchen taking FOREVER to get the food out\n\nOverall, it was just okay- don't think we'll be back...location is closer to our house but think we'll drive all the way to GV and go to Lucille's instead.", "stars": 2.0}
{"review_id": "5_488", "text": "I received a good haircut. However, the stylist needs some serious coaching about what is socially acceptable and professional conversation. I saw a 30 something woman with red hair. She never told me her name. In the half an hour I was there, I heard about her \"douche bag\" ex husband, her fiance's \"b**** ex wife,\" the fact that she herself is a \"ret**d\" for not buying something on sale (I can't believe anyone still uses that word), and the fact that she told her fiance he'd only get no sex and just get to mastur**** on their honeymoon if he smashed cake on her, etc, etc. \n\nI'm not her bestie, I'm not her therapist, I'm her customer. She needs to be coached on the difference. I did not enjoy having all of her drama dumped all over me while I was there trying to relax (which I told her) and just enjoy the precious few minutes I get to myself. Her conversation was vulgar and wildly inappropriate, not to mention one sided. I don't think she even knows my name. I had to interrupt monologue to ask for a wash (it wasn't offered), to ask if she needed to know how I part my hair, etc, etc. I could barely get a word in edgewise because she was just a constant stream of consciousness. I'm also not her \"hon.\" She should be working to build a rapport with her client if she wants to retain business, and a monologue is not the way to do that.\n\nWhile my haircut was perfectly great and a good value for the price, her total lack of appropriateness and professionalism was a total turnoff.", "stars": 2.0}

{"review_id": "5_490", "text": "The poutine here wasn't that great. For 6$, you get a relatively small sized serving (which is good I guess, if you're worried about the numbers on the scale). The cheese was definitely 'squeaky', but the fries tasted like they were in the fryer too long (i.e. they tasted burnt) and the gravy was nothing to write home about. But being in a state of inebriation, I still ate the entire thing. Such is life.\n\nConsidering Frites Alors is just down the street, I recommend going there instead.", "stars": 2.0}

{"review_id": "5_495", "text": "I've lived in the neighborhood for over 30 years. I've seen the store remodeled. I've seen parking dwindle as customer shopping has increased. Impossible store for quick parking, shopping, checkout. More importantly, the produce department ALWAYS looks terrible at 6am when they open. Unless Corporate big shots are coming-then it looks like I think it should look when the store opens. Dairy-from cheese, to yogurt, to eggs almost any morning of the week there are pallets of these type products lining the dairy aisle and no one putting them up. Note: this area sits directly underneath heat vents. Could sit there unrefrigerated for an hour or more. Certainly this could and probably does shorten shelf life. Ditto on the lunch meats etc that occupy the other side of the dairy aisle. Disappointing store in so many ways. Some nice folks work there and that is a bright spot, but, over all, not the Harris Teeter it should be. I'm still a Teeter shopper, I just drive miles away to a better store.", "stars": 2.0}
{"review_id": "5_496", "text": "Disappointed with the quality of work for the price. When I got my motorcycle back the belt deflection had well over one inch of movement with just a light touch. If I wouldn't have checked before I left my belt would of been ruined and cost me new belt, gaskets, oil, time and money. The quote was off by over 10%. I wasn't impressed, Harley-Davidson dealerships charge the same labor, there tires are a little more expensive but at the right dealership like Scottsdale they have a better quality of work and they even wipe down your motorcycle. I wouldn't go back! 2 stars only because the guys working there were patient and didn't lose their cool when I voiced how I felt.", "stars": 2.0}

{"review_id": "5_498", "text": "Went to this Wetzel's Pretzels located at San Tan Village because I had a couple of coupons for a buy one, get one and a free pretzel dip. Disappointing experience. Service was grumpy and was not engaging, and I did not feel welcome into the shop. I made my order and while going to bag my order, the cashier dropped my bag onto the floor and proceeded to pick up that same bag and use it for my pretzels and dip. When I arrived back at work to enjoy the food, I was surprised to find that my \"cheddar cheese sauce\" was a dark goldenrod colored substance that was crusty and smelled nothing like what I would expect. Will not go to this shop again.", "stars": 2.0}
